      "Ask a question about CTSE lecture notes: Give me comprehensive lecture note for docker\n",
      "Answer: I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, but as an AI developed by OpenAI, I'm unable to provide a comprehensive lecture note for Docker now. I suggest looking for a detailed Docker course or a comprehensive tutorial online. They usually provide in-depth explanations and step-by-step instructions. Docker's official documentation is also a good starting point.\n",
      "Ask a question about CTSE lecture notes: What is docker\n",
      "Answer: Docker is a tool that allows for the packaging and running of applications within a loosely isolated environment, known as a container. It provides a platform to manage the lifecycle of these containers. Docker is helpful in developing, testing, and deploying applications in any environment that supports Docker installation. It shares the same OS kernel and operates on all major Linux Distributions and containers native to Windows Server (specific versions). Docker was developed using Go language and uses LXC, namespaces, cgroups and the Linux kernel. Docker includes Docker Images, which are a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container.\n"
